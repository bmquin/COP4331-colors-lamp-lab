## **AI Usage Disclosure, Assumptions, Limitations**

This project was developed with assistance from generative AI tools:
- **Tool**: Gemini 3 Fast
- **Dates**: February 15, 2026
- **Scope**: Explanation and generation of .gitignore to prevent uploading of sensitive files to GitHub Repository, and creation of .env.example file for later potential development without leaking sensitive information
- **Use**: Gemini provided and explanation of good .gitignore practices for a LAMP stack website such as the COLORS LAMP lab site, and then generated a list of .gitignore files and directories to include, as well as an .env.example file to be used when the repo is cloned and used for development.
